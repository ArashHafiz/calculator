# Calculator
This is a calculator project I first started back in mid-2023, although I only uploaded it on GitHub a year later. It was one of my first relatively big programming projects, and I coded it in Python because its syntax was easy, beginner-friendly, and until I took on Java entering uni, was the only programming language I knew. I was also using it for my IGCSE O-Level Computer Science studies.

The calculator has a wide range of functions including:
• Simple arithmetic
• More advanced maths such as quadratics and permutations
• Conversion between many units
• Constant storage and retrieval
• Statistics

It currently only runs on CLI (a terminal). I have plans in the future to work on a GUI calculator with much of the same of functionality as this one.
